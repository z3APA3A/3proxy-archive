#   proxy
#   socks
#   pop3p
#   tcppm <SRCPORT> <DSTADDR> <DSTPORT>
#   udppm <SRCPORT> <DSTADDR> <DSTPORT>
#
#	starts proxy services
#	 proxy - HTTP/HTTPS proxy (default port 3128)
#	 socks - SOCKS 4/4.5/5 proxy (default port 1080)
#	 pop3p - POP3 proxy (default port 110)
#	 tcppm - TCP portmapper
#	 udppm - UDP portmapper
#
#	you can change default port with -pNUMBER option.
#	portmapping services listen at SRCPORT and connect to DSTADDR:DSTPORT
#	HTTP and SOCKS proxies are standard. POP3 proxy must be configured
#	as POP3 server and requires username in the form of:
#		pop3username@pop3server
#	if POP3 proxy access must be authenticated, you can specify username
#	as
#		proxy_username:proxy_password:POP3_username@pop3server
#	
#
#
#
#   log [[@|&]logfile] [<LOGTYPE>]
#	sets logfile for all gateways
#	@ - (for Unix) use syslog, filename is used as ident name
#	& - use ODBC, filename consists of comma-delimited
#		datasource,username,password (username and password are
#		optional)
#	LOGTYPE is one of:
#		M - Monthly
#		W - Weekly
#		D - Daily
#		H - Hourly
#	if logfile is not specified logging goes to stdout
#	You can specify individual logging options for gateway by using
#	-l option in gateway configuration.
#
#   rotate <n>
#	how many archived log files to keep
#
#   logformat <format>
#	Format for log record. First symbol in format must be L (local time) or G
#	(absolute time) You can use:
#
#	 %y - Year in 2 digit format
#	 %Y - Year in 4 digit format
#	 %m - Month number
#	 %d - Day
#	 %H - Hour
#	 %M - Minute
#	 %S - Second
#	 %t - Timstamp in (seconds since 01-Jan-1970)
#	 %. - milliseconds
#	 %z - timeZone (from Grinvitch)
#
#	 %U - Username
#	 %N - service Name
#	 %p - service Port
#	 %E - Error code
#	 %C - Client IP
#	 %c - Client port
#	 %R - Remote IP
#	 %r - Remote port
#	 %I - bytes In
#	 %O - bytes Out
#	 %h - Hops (redirections) count
#	 %T - service specific Text
#   in case of ODBC logging logformat specifies SQL statement, for exmample:
#   logformat "Linsert into log (l_date, l_user, l_service, l_in, l_out, l_descr)
#	values ('%d-%m-%Y %H:%M:%S', '%U', '%N', %I, %O, '%T')"
#
#   archiver <ext> <commandline>
#       Archiver to use for log files. <ext> is file extension produced by
#	archiver. Filename will be last argument to archiver, optionally you
#	can use %A as archive name and %F as filename.
#
#   timeouts <BYTE_SHORT> <BYTE_LONG> <STRING_SHORT> <STRING_LONG> <CONNECTION_SHORT> <CONNECTION_LONG> <DNS> <CHAIN>
#	Sets timeout values
#	BYTE_SHORT - short timeout for single byte, is usually used for
#		receiving single byte from stream.
#	BYTE_LONG - long timeout for single byte, is usually used for
#		receiving first byte in frame (for example first byte
#		in socks request).
#	STRING_SHORT - short timeout, for character string within stream
#		(for example to wait between 2 HTTP headers)
#	STRING_LONG - long timeout, for first string in stream (for example
#		to wait for HTTP request).
#	CONNECTION_SHORT - inactivity timeout for short connections (HTTP,
#		POP3, etc).
#	CONNECTION_LONG - inactivity timeout for long connection (SOCKS,
#		portmappers, etc).
#	DNS - timeout for DNS request before requesting next server
#	CHAIN - timeout for reading data from chained connection
#
#   nserver <ipaddr>
#	Nameserver to use for name resolutions. If none spcified system
#	or name server fails system routines for name resolution will be
#	used. It's better to specify nserver because gethostbyname() may
#	be thread unsafe.
#
#   nscache <cachesize>
#	Cache <cachesize> records for name resolution. Cachesize usually
#	should be large enougth (for example 65536).
#
#   nsrecord <hostname> <hostaddr>
#	Adds static record to nscache. nscache must be enabled. If 0.0.0.0
#	is used as a hostaddr host will never resolve.
#
#   dialer <progname>
#	Execute progname if external name can't be resolved.
#	Hint: if you use nscache, dialer may not work, because names will
#	be resolved through cache. In this case you can use something like
#       http://dial.right.now/ from browser to set up connection.
#
#
#   internal <ipaddr>
#	sets ip address of internal interface. This IP address will be used
#	to bind gateways. Alternatively you can use -i option for individual
#	gateways
#
#   external <ipaddr>
#	sets ip address of external interface. This IP address will be source
#	address for all connections made by proxy. Alternatively you can use
#	-e option to specify individual address for gateway.
#
#    service
#	Should be specified to launch as NT/2000/XP service, no effect for
#	Unix.
#
#    daemon
#	Should be specified to close console (needn't for service).
#
#    auth
#	Type of user authorization. Currently supported:
#	none - no authorization required
#	iponly - authorization by source/destination IP and ports
#	nbname - iponly + authorization by NetBIOS name. Messanger
#		service should be started on user's machine. Note, that
#		Windows 95/98 hosts do not have messanger service by default,
#		WinPopup program need to be started.
#		NB: there is no any password check, name may be spoofed.
#		Think about it as about ident for Windows.
#	 Q: Will ident authorization be implemented?
#	 A: Yes, as soon as it will be required by someone.
#	strong - username/password authentication required. It will work only
#		 with SOCKSv5 and HTTP proxy.
#
#    allow <userlist> <sourcelist> <targetlist> <targetportlist> <operationlist>
#    deny <userlist> <sourcelist> <targetlist> <targetportlist> <operationlist>
#    redirect redirect_ip redirect_port <userlist> <sourcelist> <targetlist> <targetportlist> <operationlist>
#	Access control entries. All lists are comma-separated, no spaces are
#	allowed. Usernames are case sensitive (if used with authtype nbname
#	username must be in uppercase). Source and target lists may contain
#	IP addresses (W.X.Y.Z) or CIDRs (W.X.Y.Z/L). Targetportlist may
#	contain ports (X) or port lists (X-Y).
#	* sign means "ANY".
#    	If access list is empty it's assumed to be
#		allow *
#    	If access list is not empty last item in access list is assumed to be
#		deny *
#	Access lists are checked after user have requested any resource.
#	If you want 3proxy to reject connections from specific addresses
#	immediately without any conditions you should either bind proxy
#	to appropriate interface only or to use ip filters.
#	Redirect causes connection to be accepted, but outgoing connection
#	to be redirected to different ip/port if user's connection matches
#	to rule.
#	For example
#		redirect 192.168.1.2 80 * * * 80
#	causes all outgoing web traffic to be redirected to 192.168.1.2 web
#	server. IP address of all zeros means redirect to same IP as requested.
#	Zero port number means redirect to same port as requested.
#		redirect 0.0.0.0 0
#	(both ip and port is zero)
#	has special meaning of redirection to local HTTP proxy. This type of
#	redirection is not logged.
#	Operation is one of:
#		CONNECT	- establish outgoing TCP connection
#		BIND - bind TCP port for listening
#		UDPASSOC - make UDP association
#		ICMPASSOC - make ICMP association
#		HTTP_GET - HTTP GET request
#		HTTP_PUT - HTTP PUT request
#		HTTP_POST - HTTP POST request
#		HTTP_HEAD - HTTP HEAD request
#		HTTP_CONNECT - HTTP CONNECT request
#		HTTP_OTHER - over HTTP request
#		HTTP - matches any HTTP request except HTTP_CONNECT
#		HTTPS - same as HTTP_CONNECT
#		FTP_GET - FTP get request
#		FTP_PUT - FTP put request
#		FTP_LIST - FTP list request
#		FTP - matches any FTP request
#	
#    parent <weight> <type> <ip> <port> <username> <password>
#	this command may follow "allow" rule. It extends last allow rule to
#	build proxy chain.
#	allows to build proxy chain. Proxy may be grouped. Proxy inside the
#	group is selected randomely. If few groups are specified one proxy
#	is randomely picked from each group and chain of proxies is created
#	(that is second proxy connected through first one and so on).
#	Weight is used to group proxies. Weigt is a number between 1 and 1000.
#	Weights are summed and proxies are grouped together untill weight of
#	group is 1000. That is:
#		allow *
#		parent 500 socks5 192.168.10.1 1080
#		parent 500 connect 192.168.10.1 3128
#	makes 3proxy to randomely choose between 2 proxies for all outgoing
#	connections
#		allow * * * 80
#		parent 1000 socks5 192.168.10.1 1080
#		parent 1000 connect 192.168.20.1 3128
#		parent 300 socks4 192.168.30.1 1080
#		parent 700 socks5 192.168.40.1 1080
#	creates chain of 3 proxies: 192.168.10.1, 192.168.20.1 and third
#	is (192.168.30.1 with probability of 0.3 or 192.168.40.1
#	with probability of 0.7) for outgoing web connections.
#	type is one of:
#	 tcp - simply redirect connection. TCP is always last in chain.
#		allow * * * 80
#		parent 1000 tcp 192.168.10.1 3128
#	 command pair is eqals to
#		redirect 192.168.10.1 3128 * * * 80
#
#	 http - same with tcp
#	 connect - parent is HTTP CONNECT method proxy
#	 socks4 - parent is SOCKSv4 proxy
#	 socks5 - parent is SOCKSv5 proxy
#	ip and port are ip addres and port of parent proxy server.
#	Optional username and password are used to authenticate on parent
#	proxy.
#
#    bandlimin <rate> <userlist> <sourcelist> <targetlist> <targetportlist> <operationlist>
#    nobandlimin <userlist> <sourcelist> <targetlist> <targetportlist> <operationlist>
#
#	bandlim sets bandwith limitation filter to <rate> bps (bits per second)
#	(SIC! if you wanna specife bytes per second - multiply your value to 8).
#	bandlim rules act in a same manner as allow/deny rules except
#	one thing: bandwidth limiting is applied to all services, not to some
#	specific service. 
#	bandlimin and nobandlimin applies to incoming traffic
#	bandlimout and nobandlimout applies to outgoing traffic
#	If tou want to ratelimit your clients with ip's 192.168.10.16/30 (4
#	addresses) to 57600 bps you have to specify 4 rules like
#	  bandlimin 57600 * 192.168.10.16
#	  bandlimin 57600 * 192.168.10.17
#	  bandlimin 57600 * 192.168.10.18
#	  bandlimin 57600 * 192.168.10.19
#	and every of you clients will have 56K channel.
#	if you specify
#	  bandlimin 57600 * 192.168.10.16/30
#	you will have 56K channel shared between all clients.
#	if you want, for example, to limit all speed ecept access to POP3
#	you can use
#	 nobandlimin * * * 110
#	before the rest of bandlim rules.e
#
#    counter <filename> <reporttype> <repotname>
#    countin <number> <type> <limit> <userlist> <sourcelist> <targetlist> <targetportlist> <operationlist>
#    nocountin <userlist> <sourcelist> <targetlist> <targetportlist> <operationlist>
#
#	counter, countin, nocountin commands are used to set traffic limit
#	in MB for period of time (day, week or month). Filename is a path
#	to a special file where traffic information is permanently stored.
#	number is sequential number of record in this file. If number is 0
#	no traffic information  on this counter is saved in file (that is
#	if proxy restarted all information is loosed) overwise it should be
#	unique sequential number.
#	Type specifies a type of counter. Type is one of:
#		D - counter is resetted daily
#		W - counter is resetted weekly
#		M - counter is resetted monthely
#	reporttype/repotname may be used to generate traffic reports.
#	Reporttype is one of D,W,M,H(hourly) and repotname specifies filename
#	template for reports. Report is text file with counter values in
#	format:
#		<COUNTERNUMBER> <TRAF*4GB> <TRAF>
#	The rest of parameters is identical to bandlim/nobandlim.
#
#
#    users username[:pwtype:password] ...
#	pwtype is one of:
#		none (empty) - use system authentication
#		CL - password is cleartext
#		CR - password is crypt-style password
#		NT - password is NT password (in hex)
#	example:
# users test1:CL:password1 "test2:CR:$1$lFDGlder$pLRb4cU2D7GAT58YQvY49." test3:NT:BD7DFBF29A93F93C63CB84790DA00E63
#	
#
#    flush
#	empty active access list
#
#    system
#	execute system command
#
#    setuid <uid>
#	call setuid(uid), uid must be numeric. Unix only.
#
#    setgid <gid>
#	call setgid(gid), gid must be numeric. Unix only.
#
#    chroot <path>
#	call chroot(path). Unix only.
#

auth iponly
#auth nbname
#auth strong
# auth specifies type of user authentication. If you specify none proxy
# will not do anything to check name of the user. If you specify
# nbname proxy will send NetBIOS name request packet to UDP/137 of
# client and parse request for NetBIOS name of messanger service.
# Strong means that proxy will check password. For strong authentication
# unknown user will not be allowed to use proxy regardless of ACL.
# If you do not want username to be checked but wanna ACL to work you should
# specify auth iponly.

# to port 80 to our Web-server 192.168.0.2.
# We will allow any outgoing connections from network 192.168.1.0/24 to
# SMTP, POP3, FTP, DNS and unprivileged ports.
# Note, that redirect may also be used with proxy or portmapper. It will
# allow you to redirect requests to different ports or different server
# for different clients.

#  sharing access to internet

external 0.0.0.0
# external is address 3proxy uses for outgoing connections. 0.0.0.0 means any
# interface. Using 0.0.0.0 is not good because it allows to connect to 127.0.0.1

internal 127.0.0.1
# internal is address of interface proxy will listen for incoming requests
# 127.0.0.1 means only localhost will be able to use this proxy. This is
# address you should specify for clients as proxy IP.
# You MAY use 0.0.0.0 but you shouldn't, because it's a chance for you to
